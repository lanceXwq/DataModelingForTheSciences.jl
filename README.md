# DataModelingForTheSciences.jl

This repository contains my Julia codes for my PhD PI, Steve Presse's [textbook](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/data-modeling-for-the-sciences/61C0E9959A38442F715287A0E2057BAA). These codes may be related figure generation, example demonstration, short derivations, and even problem solutions[^1].

[^1]: Problem solutions will probably be removed in the future.

## Form of my implementation

My implementation will either be in pure Julia or [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks.

## Setup dependencies

Run `julia packages-lx.jl` to install all the packages used in Lance's Pluto notebooks.
